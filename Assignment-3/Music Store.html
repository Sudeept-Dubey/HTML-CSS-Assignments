        <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that usually has six strings. 
        It is typically played with both hands by strumming or plucking the strings 
        with either a guitar pick or the fingers/fingernails of one hand, 
        while simultaneously fretting (pressing the strings against the frets) 
        with the fingers of the other hand. The sound of the vibrating strings
        is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the 
        guitar (for an acoustic guitar), or through an electrical amplifier and a speaker.

      <p>The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and 
          strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other 
          chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded 
          by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the 
          five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development 
          of the modern six-string instrument.

        There are three main types of modern acoustic guitar: 
        the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar), 
        the steel-string acoustic guitar and the archtop guitar, which 
        is sometimes called a "jazz guitar". The tone of an acoustic 
        guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the 
        hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber. 
        The classical guitar is often played as a solo instrument using
         a comprehensive finger-picking technique where each string is 
         plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being 
         strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific 
         tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in 
         the United States. The acoustic bass guitar is a low-pitched instrument
          that is one octave below a regular guitar.

            The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) 
            in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest 
            and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. 
            The violin typically has four strings, usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes 
            G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. 
            It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, 
            in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow

            The piano is an acoustic, stringed musical instrument invented in Italy by
             Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 (the exact year is uncertain), 
             in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a 
             softer material (modern hammers are covered with dense wool felt; 
             some early pianos used leather). It is played using a keyboard, 
             which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses 
             down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause 
             the hammers to strike the strings.

            The tabla[nb 1] is a pair of twin hand drums from the Indian subcontinent. 
            Since 18th century, tabla has been the principal percussion instrument in 
            Hindustani classical music,where it may be played solo, as accompaniment 
            with other instrument and vocals, and as a part of larger ensembles. 
            Tabla is also frequently played in popular and folk music performances in 
            India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. 
            The tabla is also an important instrument in the bhakti devotional traditions 
            of Hinduism and Sikhism, such as during bhajan and kirtan singing. 
            It is one of the main qawali instrument used by Sufi musicians. 
            Tabla also features in dance performances such as Kathak.
